This website serves to provide a visualization of different maze generation and maze solving algorithms.<br/>
I got most of the ideas implimented here from [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyK_Q5rrcr4) yt tutorial series from the coding train.<br/>
The generation algorithms included are:
  * Depth First Search
  * Prim's Algorithm
  * Kruskal's Algorithm
  * Binary Tree
  * Sidewinder <br/>
  
The solving algorithms included are:
 * Breadth First Search
 * Dead-end Fill
 * A* 

I have made seperate .js files for each algorithm so that they can be analized and run individually. This however does result in a lot of redundant code.
